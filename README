not much to say for now.

hellow_py is a msn client lib.
the design is simple for studing other langs

Not designed to BE an MSN complete msn client!

The main goal here is education!

there is other version of the code in java, that is quite similar! You can watch both and learn more of each language

The final version, is not a final version itself. It is design to be used in refactoring workshops. So it's desined to be ugly.
Be scared!
